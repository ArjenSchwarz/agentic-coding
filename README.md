# Agentic Coding process

This repository contains my current process for working with agentic coding assistants. It's focused around spec-driven development and has a number of helpful tools and commands. Feel free to use what you see here and/or propose improvements.

The framework now includes cross-platform support with GitHub Copilot prompt files, enhanced peer review capabilities with multiple AI system consultation, and improved workflow management with the rune CLI integration.

## Commands

The framework includes commands for a complete feature development workflow (detailed in [spec-workflow](spec-workflow.md)):

- **`requirements`** - Generate and refine feature requirements in EARS format
- **`design`** - Create design documents based on approved requirements
- **`tasks`** - Convert designs into actionable implementation task lists
- **`next-task`** - Execute the next group of tasks from the implementation plan
- **`commit`** - Format, stage, and commit changes with proper changelog management
- **`release-prep`** - Prepare the project for a new release with quality checks and documentation updates

## Agents

The framework provides specialized AI agents for different aspects of development. These are defined for use in Claude Code, and not every tool supports sub-agents like this. Some agents have dependencies on external CLI tools (e.g., peer-review-validator requires Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Q Developer CLI for consulting external AI systems).

- **`code-simplifier`** - Reviews code for complexity reduction and maintainability improvements
- **`design-critic`** - Provides critical review of design documents and architecture proposals (now using Sonnet model for improved efficiency)
- **`efficiency-optimizer`** - Analyzes code for performance optimization opportunities
- **`peer-review-validator`** - Validates decisions by consulting with at least two external AI systems (Gemini, Codex, or Q Developer) to ensure balanced perspective
- **`pre-push-code-reviewer`** - Critically reviews unpushed commits before pushing to ensure code quality and spec adherence
- **`research-agent`** - Conducts research and generates structured reports (stolen from @sammcj)
- **`ui-ux-reviewer`** - Evaluates user interfaces for usability and accessibility improvements

## Workflow

1. Start with `requirements` to define what needs to be built
2. Use `design` to plan the architecture and approach
3. Generate implementation steps with `tasks`
4. Execute incrementally using `next-task`
5. Commit progress using `commit`

Each phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding to ensure quality and alignment.

## File Structure

Feature work is organized in `specs/{feature_name}/` directories containing:
- `requirements.md` - Feature requirements in EARS format
- `design.md` - Design document
- `tasks.md` - Implementation task checklist
- `decision_log.md` - Decisions and rationales

## GitHub Copilot Integration

The `copilot/prompts/` directory contains prompt files for GitHub Copilot users. These prompts mirror the command functionality and can be used directly in GitHub Copilot:

- **`requirements.prompt.md`** - Requirements gathering prompt
- **`design.prompt.md`** - Design document creation prompt
- **`tasks.prompt.md`** - Task planning prompt
- **`next-task.prompt.md`** - Next task execution prompt
- **`commit.prompt.md`** - Commit formatting and changelog management prompt
- **`pr-prep.prompt.md`** - Pull request preparation prompt
- **`design-critic.chatmode.md`** - Design critique chat mode prompt

## Scripts Directory

The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts for AI-assisted development. To use these scripts in your projects:

1. Create a symlink in your project:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/code/agentic-coding/scripts .claude/scripts
   ```

2. Add to your project's `.gitignore`:
   ```
   .claude/scripts
   ```

This approach allows you to use the scripts across multiple projects without committing them to each repository, keeping them centralized and easy to update.

This framework is designed to work with various AI coding tools including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cline.

## CLAUDE.md Configuration

The `CLAUDE.md` file contains user-level instructions that guide AI behavior when working with this framework. Key guidelines include:

- Emphasis on simplicity and understandable code
- Avoiding hyperbolic language and sycophantic responses
- Feature-based development using the specs directory structure
- Language-specific rules (e.g., Go development patterns in `language-rules/go.md`)
- Mandatory use of linters and validators after writing code

These instructions can be copied to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or project-specific `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to ensure consistent AI behavior across your projects.
