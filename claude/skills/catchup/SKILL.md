# Catch Up on Branch Changes

You need to help me understand what work has been done on this branch. Please:

1. Get the current branch name
2. Identify the base branch (usually 'main' or 'master')
3. Get a summary of commits since branching
4. List all changed files (added, modified, deleted)
5. Read through the changed files to understand:
   - What features were added
   - What bugs were fixed
   - What refactoring was done
   - Any important architectural changes
6. Provide a clear summary organized by:
   - Overall purpose of the changes
   - Key files and their changes
   - Notable patterns or themes
   - Any concerns or areas that might need attention

Focus on understanding the "why" behind changes, not just listing what changed. Be concise but thorough.
