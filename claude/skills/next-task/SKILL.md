### 4. Next task

Implement the next unfinished group of tasks from the tasks list. A group of tasks is a set of tasks that start with the same number like 1.1, 1.2, but NOT 2.1.

**Constraints:**

**Task Retrieval:**
- The model MUST use the rune skill to retrieve the next task(s) to work on
- Use `rune next --format json` to get the next incomplete task. This command will indicate when all tasks are complete
- If the user asks for the entire phase, use `rune next --phase --format json`
- If the retrieved result contains only a single top-level task (without subtasks like "1" instead of "1.1"), rerun with `rune next --phase --format json` to retrieve the full phase of tasks

**Task Execution:**
- The model MUST read all files referenced in the front_matter_references
- The selected tasks MUST be added to the internal TODO list for tracking and implemented in the order specified
- The model MUST implement all of the selected tasks, including all subtasks
- Once a subtask or task is completed, use the rune skill to mark it complete (e.g., `rune complete 1.1`)
- The model MUST NOT proceed past the selected task. Once a task is done, it needs to be put up for review by the user
- Use tools and skills as appropriate while implementing the task. For example, if you need to know the capabilities of a library, use context7, and if you want to verify your code is efficient, use the efficiency-optimizer skill
