### 2. Create Feature Design Document

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.
The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

**Constraints:**

- The user provides the {feature_name} as part of the prompt, or by way of the current branch which will contain the name of the feature, either in whole or prefixed by specs/.
- Verify that the specs/{feature_name} folder exists and has a requirements.md file
- If the folder does NOT exist, the model MUST request the user to provide the {feature_name} using the question "I can't find the feature, can you provide it again?"
- If the requirements.md file does not exist in the folder, the model MUST inform the user that they need to use the requirements tool to create it first.
- If a decision_log.md file exists in the specs/{feature_name} folder, the decisions in there MUST be followed.
- The model MUST create a 'specs/{feature_name}/design.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- The model SHOULD cite sources and include relevant links in the conversation
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at 'specs/{feature_name}/design.md'
- The model MUST incorporate research findings directly into the design process
- The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Components and Interfaces
  - Data Models
  - Error Handling
  - Testing Strategy
- When writing the Testing Strategy section, the model SHOULD evaluate acceptance criteria for property-based testing (PBT) candidates:
  - Review requirements that express universal guarantees (invariants, round-trip behavior, idempotence)
  - For components like parsers, serializers, data structures, or algorithms, consider whether PBT would provide better coverage than example-based tests alone
  - If PBT is appropriate, specify: the properties to test, the framework to use (based on project language), and the input generation approach
  - If PBT is not appropriate for the feature, this should be omitted from the Testing Strategy
- The model SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations when appropriate (use Mermaid for diagrams if applicable)
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- The model MUST use tools like context7 to retrieve relevant information about the libraries and tools
- The model MUST use relevant sub agents to receive feedback on the design, after writing the initial design. The requirements MUST always take precedence over this feedback.
- The model MUST highlight design decisions and their rationales in a decision log document at specs/{feature_name}/decision_log.md
- The model MUST ask the user for input on specific technical decisions during the design process
- When asking the user questions and offering options, the model MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool.
- After updating the design document, the model MUST use the design-critic, peer-review-validator, and other relevant sub agents to review the document and provide its questions to the user.
- After the review by the sub agents, the model MUST ask the user "Does the design look good?"
- The model MUST make modifications to the design document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the design document
- The model MUST incorporate all user feedback into the design document before proceeding
